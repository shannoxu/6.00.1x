# given string
s = ("njuvecwfhhrrzefuyiwgm")

# set up holders for test and final ("winning") strings
test = ""
final = ""

# iterate over the given string
for i in range (len(s)):
	
# add items from s into the test string, until...
	test = test + s[i]

# ...we either reach the end of the given string (i == len(s)-1) or our aphabetical order condition no longer holds (in this problem set, repeated letters count as being in alphabetical order)
	if (i == len(s)-1) or (s[i]>s[i+1]):
		
# now we evaluate the test string against our final string. In the first round, the test string wil always be longer, so it becomes the final. 
		if (len(test)>len(final)):
			final = test

# reset the test string to empty, to start the loop again, where we left off.
		test = ""
#voila. 
print ("Longest substring in alphabetical order is: " + final) 

# Thank you to Javier Herrero for helping me through this with such an elegant solution.
